# 1.1 - Is Unique
#
# Implement and algorithm to determine if a string has all unique characters.
# What if you cannot use additional data structure?

def is_unique?(str)

end


# 1.2 - Check Permutation
#
# Given two strings, write a method to decide if one is a permutaion of the
# other.

def permutaion?(str1, str2)

end


# 1.3 - URLify
#
# Write a method to replace all spaces in a string with '%20'. You may assume
# that the string has a sufficient space at the end to hold the additional
# characters, and that you are given the "true" length of the string.
#
# EXAMPLE
# Input:    "Mr John Smith    ", 13
# Output:   "Mr%20John%20Smith"

def urlify(str, len)

end


# 1.4 - Palindrome Permutation
#
# Given a string, write a function to check if it is a permutation of a palindrome.
# A palindrome is a word or phrase that is the same forwards and backwards. A
# permutation is a rearrangement of letters. The palindrome does not need to be
# limited to just dictionary words.
#
# EXAMPLE
# input:    "Tact Coa"
# output:   True (permutations: "taco cat", "acto cta", ect.)

def palindrome_permutation(str)

end


# 1.5 - One Away
#
# There are three types if edits that can be preformed on strings: insert a
# character, remove a character, or replace a character. Given two strings,
# write a function to check if they are one edit (or zero edits) away.
#
# EXAMPLE
# pale,   ple     -> true
# pales,  pale    -> true
# pale,   bale    -> true
# pale,   bake    -> false

def one_away(str1, str2)

end


# 1.6 - String Compression
#
# Implement a method to perform basic string compression using the counts of
# repeated characters. For example, the strinfg 'aabcccccaaa' would become
# 'a2b1c5a3'. If the 'compressed' string would not become smaller than the
# originazl string, your method should retrun the original string. you can
# assumer the string has only uppercased and lowercase letters (a-z).

def string_compression(str)

end


# 1.7 - Rotate Matrix
#
# Given an image represented by an NxN matrix, where each pixel in the image is
# 4 bytes, write a method to rotate the image by 90 degrees. Can you do this in
# place?

def rotate_image(image)

end


# 1.8 - Zero matrix
#
# Write an algorithm such that if an element in an MxN matrix is 0, itâ€™s entire
# row and column are set to 0.

def zero_matrix(matrix)

end


# 1.9 - String Rotation
#
# Assume you have a method is_substring? which checks if one word is a substring
# of another. Given two strings, str1 and str2, write code to check if str2 is a
# rotation of str1 using only one call to is_substring? (e.g. 'waterbottle' is a
# rotation of 'erbottlewat')

def string_rotation?(str1, str2)

end
