# Cracking the coding Interview Questions and Test Suite

This repository is a collection of programming questions from Cracking the
Coding Interview 6th Edition. The questions, solutions, and test suites are
written in both Ruby and JavaScript with rspec and mocha as the testing
environments respectively.

## JavaScript

- Navigate to the `javascript` directory
- `npm install`

Test suite is bound to `test` command so all that is needed is to run:

```
npm test
```

To run a single test:
```
npm test <path_to_test>
```


## Ruby

- Navigate to the `ruby` directory
- `bundle install`
- Run test suite through rspec
